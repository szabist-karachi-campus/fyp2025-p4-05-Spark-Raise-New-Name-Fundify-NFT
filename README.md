Fundify NFT is built on the Polygon Blockchain to ensure low transaction fees and fast confirmation times.
NFTs are minted as proof of contribution to crowdfunding campaigns. Each NFT represents the contributor’s participation in the project.

Polygon → For scalable, low-cost smart contracts.

MongoDB → For storing off-chain campaign details and user data.

IPFS → For decentralized storage of images, documents, and NFT metadata.

Smart Contracts → Handle campaign creation, contributions, and NFT minting.
